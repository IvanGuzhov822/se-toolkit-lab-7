## Lab story

> "The best way to understand an API is to build a client for it."

You will use an AI coding agent (Qwen Code) to build a Telegram bot client for the LMS backend you deployed in previous labs. The bot talks to your backend, fetches real data, and uses an LLM to answer natural language questions.

## Learning advice

This lab is about learning to collaborate with an AI coding agent as a development partner. You are not following step-by-step instructions — you are building a product.

Use your coding agent to help you plan and implement:

> Here are the requirements. Create a development plan.

> Scaffold the project with a testable handler architecture.

> Implement /health — it should call GET /items on my backend and report the status.

> The bot should understand plain text like "which lab has the lowest pass rate?" — implement intent routing.

The bot you build is practical (~200-400 lines). The learning comes from the iterative process of planning, building, testing, and debugging with agent assistance.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Use an AI coding agent to plan and implement a client application.
- Design a testable handler architecture (logic separated from transport).
- Connect a client to an existing REST API with authentication.
- Implement natural language intent routing using LLM tool/function calling.
- Debug integration issues iteratively with agent assistance.
- Deploy a multi-service system (backend + bot) on a remote VM.

In simple words, you should be able to say:
>
> 1. I built a Telegram bot that talks to my backend!
> 2. I can ask it questions in plain language and it fetches the right data!
> 3. I used an AI coding agent to plan and build the whole thing!
